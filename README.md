With the help of this programme, zookeepers can interact with animals by adding, checking, or removing them from the zoo, simulating a basic zoo management system. Console-based interactivity is used in this C# system implementation.

How to Launch the Programme:
Conditions:

Make that your C# development environment (Visual Studio,.NET SDK, etc.) is configured.
Actions:
Download or clone the source code.
Launch the solution using your Visual Studio or other C# IDE.
Run the Program.cs file after compiling it.
To interact with the zoo management system, follow the prompts displayed on the screen.
Anticipated Mistakes:
Some typical problems, including erroneous input during weight entering or animal selection, are appropriately handled by the application.
A valid numeric figure will be requested by the programme if the weight of an animal is input wrongly.
upcoming implementations
Conversion to Desktop Application: For a more user-friendly experience, improve the system with a GUI by utilising Windows Forms or WPF.
Git version control:

Utilise Git to implement version control so that you may collaborate on the codebase and monitor changes.
Give credit:
Lwazi Dlamini is the developer.
This project can be expanded with new features and enhancements to provide a foundation for a more complete zoo management system.

Basic guidelines and information on the Dlamini Zoo Management System are provided in this README. Consider updating the application with a graphical user interface (GUI) and more robust error handling for additional improvements and comprehensive documentation.
